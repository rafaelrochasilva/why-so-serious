Why So Serious?
==============

##The Problem

Our goal in creating this app was to bring a little more levity and laughter to the world.  We wanted users to not just create and/or submit jokes, but to combine their jokes with images.  Some users might want to use the images to create the jokes, and some might want to use the jokes to select a combination of images.

Laugh and the world laughs with you!
